Seng 300 Group 11 Assignment 1 Guidelines

To be Submitted:
1. Source Code for the Java Application Assignment
2. Automated Test Suites for testing the application
3. Structural Diagram
4. Sequence Diagram
5. State Diagram
6. Optional Supplementary explanation
7. Git log

Source Code Requirements:
1. Takes a pathname to indicate a directory of interest
2. Takes a string to indicate a fully qualified name of a Java type
3. Counts the number of declarations of that type within that directory
4. Counts the number of references to each occurrence of that type within that directory
5. The output must a string written to the console stating the name of the type, the count of delcarations, and the count of references;

	<type>. Declarations found: <count>; references found: <count>.

where the <type> and two <count>s are to be replaced with the relevant values.

Notes for creating the source code:
1. ASTParser could be used to find class declarations.
	In the ASTParser, a visitor can be created so that the visitor could visit nodes in the AST.
	The nodes that can be visited by the visitor are 'Class' type declarations node in which could simplify
	out parsing of the .java file for counting how many delcarations we have encountered.


Automated Test Suites Requirements:
1. Logical Test Case Selection
	a) Consider checking for error and exceptions
	b) Consider checking for expected results
	c) Consider assertions
2. Coverage

Git Log
1. Demonstrates who performed commits over time.
