 * occurences of the declarations of and references to a Java type (as a 
 * fully qualified name, like java.lang.String), within a specified 
 * directory.
 *
 *	Input:
 * This takes in pathname to indicate a directory of interest.
 * Takes a string to indicate a fully qualified name of a Java type.
 *	
 *	Process:
 * The java application counts the number of declarations of that type
 * within that directory and counts that number of references to each 
 * occurrence of that type within that directory.
 * 
 *	Output:
 * The output is a string written to the console stating the name of the 
 * type, the count of declarations, and the count of references, such as:
 * 
 * 		<type>. Declarations found: <count>; references found: <count>.
 * 
 * where the <type> and two <count>s are to be replaced with the relevant 
 * values.
